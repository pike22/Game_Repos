# Game_Repos:
    This is one method of backing up my game to an external location so that if my main drive that this is saved on.
    It is also a nice to be able to see where my code was and how much has changed since the start of this massive project. 
    

# About me:
    As of current I am a seinor at Maumee High School, I participate in 3 sports for my school (soccer, bowling, Track & Field) 
    My favorite hobbies include coding, playing cards, enjoying a good video game, and reading. I also have heavy interests on the hardware side of computers. 
  

# Info: 
    If you want previouse progress reports I have the entirety of those saved on a file named 'info.txt'
    It holds a crude summary of what I worked on during that week and what I was able to get done.
    
  
# how it all started
    I have been working on this project since my sophmore year, with the game going through a lot of changes as my time progressed
  some of that time was also spent on learning how to code in python. Before that year I had no knowledge in any language other than scratch. 
  I was tired of just following tutorials never truly learning anything. 
    After learning python from my teacher I resarched different GUI resourses to use with python. I after finding a good tutorial to learn some 
  basics of the software (that I havn't used much of) I began work on the project that you see now. Starting from alpha v.0.6 because of past work I started to 
  organise what I was actually doing. Begining to do almost everything on my own with out the help of libraries. I learned the hard way that sometimes finding
  a library someone else made lead to a easier time. With alpha v.0.6 was when I had my first major rework. Nothing about the individuall classes were changed 
  all I had done was organise a file system rather than my previouse method of coding where I put almost every class onto one file. Some of the time a version change 
  was because of a major change in the code, other times it was just because I felt enough had changed to warrent a version change.
