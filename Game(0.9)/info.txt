Every Friday I will be pushing adding a small summary of the last week of this projects progression.
This first summary is more of a general overview than just the last week being that this is the first of
many. 

Summary:
	This is a small High school project that I have decided to dedicate more time than probably necessary to do.
	Although I am doing this for fun with the benefits from a finished product. The overall goal is to create some
	form of 2D game that is based around a dungeon crawler. This may change overtime. I have no name or story in mind yet.
	This is more due to being to early in game development.
