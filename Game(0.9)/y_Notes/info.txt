Every Friday I will be pushing adding a small summary of the last week of this projects progression.
This first summary is more of a general overview than just the last week being that this is the first of
many. If you want to run the code run the alpha.py file. 

 -Overall Summary:
	This is a small High school project that I have decided to dedicate more time than probably necessary to do.
	Although I am doing this for fun with the benefits from a finished product. The overall goal is to create some
	form of 2D game that is based around a dungeon crawler. This may change overtime. I have no name or story in mind yet.
	This is more due to being to early in game development. Daily updates to Github will be normal.
	- A summary of weekly events will continue to be added bellow as time moves forward.


 -09/17/2021 Summary of weeks work
 	This weeks work only had some small changes. None of these changes are to be permanent for the most part due to that most
	was written in attempts to work out how to use the implemented collision. I figured that just shoving ideas into code wasn't
	going to work so I took some time outside of the code to put together an Idea for what to do. With some help from my teacher
	we came up with the idea to use Dictionaries. Something I haven't used since when I first reconstructed my classes.
