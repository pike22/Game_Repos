ID for an Entity refers to the tag of the target Entity.

There will be a group ID to identify groups of entities
	Ex: ID = #player
		 ID = #stalfos
		 ID = #weapon
This sets of ID's refer to a group of entities.
 using .find_withtag(tagOrID) can use the above examples to find a spacific entity without looking into every created entity.

Every Entity needs to have a my_Collision func. This function will have basic uses for Collision. It will take a call from the Colliison_logic class
and use the information given to decide further what to do.


	Here is some example collision

	# #_EXAMPLE COLLIISON_#
	# for item in range(len(self.__collision)):
	# 	if item == 0:
	# 		tagOrId = self.__collision[item]
	# 		obj1	= self.__Col_Dict[tagOrId]
	# 		self.__health1 = obj1.get_health()
	# 		attack1 = obj1.get_attack()
	# 		defense1 = obj1.get_defense()
	# 	elif item == 1:
	# 		tagOrId = self.__collision[item]
	# 		obj2	= self.__Col_Dict[tagOrId]
	# 		self.__health2 = obj2.get_health()
	# 		attack2 = obj2.get_attack()
	# 		defense2 = obj2.get_defense()
	#
	# self.__health1 -= attack2
	# print(obj1.get_ID(), 'has', self.__health1, 'health')
	# obj1.set_health(self.__health1)
